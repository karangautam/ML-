    "In machine learning, if we are given a dataset for either classification or regression. Random guess will create an output randomly. Now it is extremely important to understand the meaning of random here, random does not mean out of the Blue. For e.g. if I toss a coin and I ask you what would be the outcome you will reply either \"heads\" or \"tails\" which one I don't know, this is randomness. But any other answer apart from \"heads\" and \"tail\" is not Random , its stupid :) . \n",
